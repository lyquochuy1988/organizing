                                ongoing training certificates. Your income expense files. Your passport and other travel documents, including your vaccination certificate. How many times have you had to search in your bag, your phone, in your laptop,
                                or whereever else you put these things? Each time you have to dig up these documents and put all the needed documents in one place, it takes at least three and half hours of work on an average. And this does not even count
                                the stress and aggravation. What if you could find all your documents neatly categorized, all ready to find, ready to send to someone, ready to print out, or just ready to show to someone, such as at an airport? The Life
                                Organizer App does just that!</p>
